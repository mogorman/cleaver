this is a project to build a soldering iron driver for the hakko 907 5 pin style irons


ideas:
8x2 display
pot for temperature control and switch for on off
led to show on
led to show heating
buzzer?

2 boards one for lcd and pot other for soldering iron connector and power supply connector

internal temperature sensor for thermal compensation


attiny85
1 led, iron is safe / reset
2 Temperature probe from iron
3 pot for control of the iron
4 Gnd
5 SDA for display
6 pwm for iron, led to alert user its heating
7 SCL for display
8 Vcc, led to show its on



red / green bi led for power / heat
